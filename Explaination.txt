# Project Name: Question-Answer using LLM (LArge Language Model)


Description:
This project demonstrates the usage of various Python libraries and tools to perform web scraping, text preprocessing, PDF generation, and question answering using AI models. 
The code fetches content from a website, extracts specific information, preprocesses text data, generates a PDF document, and uses an AI model for question answering.

Dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - requests
  - beautifulsoup4
  - transformers
  - sentence-transformers
  - faiss-cpu
  - pandas
  - nltk
  - chromadb
  - langchain
  - unstructured
  - docx2txt
  - reportlab
  - genai

Installation Instructions:
1. Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 transformers sentence-transformers faiss-cpu pandas nltk chromadb langchain unstructured docx2txt reportlab genai
